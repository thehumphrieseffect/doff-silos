Project Overview

This workflow enables direct ArcSDE exports of .shp into folders for use by AutoCAD.
This is intended to be automated via a Task Scheduler.

Problem:
Due to software version and interoperability issues, the FDO connection
function within AutoCAD fails to connect to ESRI's SDE.
Stack: SQL Server with SDE v 10.3, ArcGIS Desktop 10.4, AutoCAD v 16.

Solution:
Export .shp directly from SDE to folders viewable on network. Automate process for
weekly cycle, create .log file for reference, create â€˜script fail' email.
